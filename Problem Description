Problem:
Many times we go to silence zones but forget to switch our mobile to silence mode and that can create embarrassing situations. 
Proposed Solution:
Desiging an app that stores specified locations ,be it class or office or library, it checks the current location everytime
in some interval and if it is near any of the saved locations, it makes the mobile go silent.
